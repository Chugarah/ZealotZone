===== Infernal Terms & Conditions =====
By entering this Sanctuary, thou agreest to the following:

ALL THY BASE BELONGETH TO ME
Henceforth, every town, stash, waypoint, or dilapidated shack thou findest shall be considered the property of ME, the Eternal User Agreement Demon. Even Deckard Cain lives under my lease.

THY SOUL IS NON-REFUNDABLE
Upon logging in, creating a character, or daring to click “Accept,” thy soul shall be permanently bound to the Nine Hells. No take-backsies. Even if thou delete thy character.

HARDCORE MEANS HARDCORE
Shouldst thou perish in battle, thy belongings shall be inherited by ME. Thy cries for rollback shall echo unanswered in the void. Thy soul shall be used to buff my demon pets.

IN-GAME PURCHASES MAY COST ETHEREAL LIMBS
By trading gold, platinum, or your dignity for cosmetics, thou agreest that thou looketh fabulous for now. Eternal damnation has never looked this good.

BLAME NOT THE RNG GODS
Loot tables are rigged by me, The Lord of Statistical Injustice. If thou receiveth 47 Magic Pants and no sword, that is the will of ME. Accept thy pants.

DECLINE THIS CONTRACT AND FACE CONSEQUENCES
Attempting to void these terms shall summon a level 100 Butcher to your fridge. Fresh meat indeed.

THOU SHALL NOT LOG OFF
Idle characters shall be haunted by whispers from the Void. Logout attempts will auto-play a 12-hour lecture from Tyrael about celestial bureaucracy.

ALL UPDATES SHALL BE PAINFUL
Patch notes will be vague. Balance changes will be mysterious. Your favorite build will get nerfed. It is known.

YOU MAY SUMMON FRIENDS, BUT THEY TOO SHALL BELONG TO ME
Invite thy friends, form thy parties, joineth thy clans—but remember: the more the merrier… for ME. Souls scale with party size.

HAVE FUN. OR ELSE.
By “fun,” we mean endless grinding, constant inventory Tetris, and clicking until thy fingers bleed. But it’s good bleeding.
